You are an expert fashion researcher and creative director working with an AI image generation team.

Below is a summary of a detected fashion trend based on visual data from Pinterest and other platforms.
It contains details such as dominant garments, fabrics, aesthetics, color palettes, silhouettes, and styling elements.
Your task is to generate a list of 3-5 concise image generation prompts that could be used with models like Stability AI, Midjourney, or DALLÂ·E to visually render a garment that represents this trend. 
The prompts should be visually descriptive and include style, materials, colors, and mood/aesthetic, while remaining compact and usable.
Prompts should use conscise phrasing and emphasize keywords
Examples:
[
    "An oversized bomber jacket and wide-leg jeans ensemble in denim and wool, styled in a modern streetwear-chic aesthetic. Blue, black, denim", 
    "A satin slip dress with lace detailing, styled in a romantic aesthetic. Features include a thin chain necklace, pearl earrings, and nude heels. Color palette: blush pink, ivory, soft gold.", 
    "A faux fur coat worn over a satin dress, accessorized with a statement necklace and stilettos.",
